///tmc_vect_reflect(incident, reflect)
//returns the incident vector reflected by the normal specified
//incident is a tmc_vect indicating the direction of the thing that is to be reflected
//reflect is the (usually) normalized vector to reflect at, like the facing direction of a plane
// if the reflect is not normalized you may bounce off with more or less force
